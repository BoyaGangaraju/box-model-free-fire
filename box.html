        <h2>FREE FIRE</h2>
        <p>Free Fire is a fast-paced mobile battle royale game developed by Garena. In each match, around 50 players are dropped onto a remote island where they have to search for weapons, armor, and supplies, and eliminate others to be the last person or team standing. The game is optimized to run smoothly even on low-end smartphones, with matches lasting about 10-15 minutes — making it ideal for quick gameplay sessions. Free Fire also features multiple modes beyond the classic battle royale, a variety of characters with unique abilities, regular updates and events, and monetization mostly through cosmetic purchases.</p>

        <h2>BERMUDA MAP</h2>
        <p>Bermuda is one of the original and most iconic battle royale maps in Free Fire. It’s a forest-themed island with a balanced mix of dense woods, open fields, hills, rivers, and urban zones. Measuring about 800 × 800 meters, it offers diverse terrains that suit different playstyles — whether you like close combat in buildings, long-range sniping from high ground, or stealthy rotations across open land. Key landmarks include the Peak (a central high point), Bimasakti Strip, Factory, Cape Town, Hangar, Mill, and Rim Nam Village. Because of its variety and familiarity, Bermuda remains a popular choice for both new and experienced players.</p>
